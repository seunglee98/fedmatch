The goal of fedmatch is to match un-linked datasets. It provides a variety of tools that allow a user to build a custom matching algorithm for their specific application. To get started, see the ["Introduction to fedmatch" vignette](https://seunglee98.github.io/fedmatch/articles/Intro-to-fedmatch.html). 

You can view all the vignettes, and the rest of the documentation, on the [fedmatch website](https://seunglee98.github.io/fedmatch/).


## Features

- String cleaning tools
- Fuzzy matching with standard string distance metrics from the package `stringdist`
- A new fuzzy matching method which we call a *Weighted Jaccard* metric
- Numeric matching using a trained logit model
- A system to sequentially execute many different types of match algorithms
- A system for evaluating matches post-hoc
