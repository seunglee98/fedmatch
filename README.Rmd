The goal of fedmatch is to match un-linked datasets. It provides a variety of tools that allow a user to build a custom matching algorithm for their specific application. To get started, see the "Introduction to Fedmatch" vignette by installing fedmatch and running `vignette("Intro-to-fedmatch")`. For more advanced uses, see the rest of the vignettes by running `vignette(package = "fedmatch")`.

You can view all the vignettes, and the rest of the documentation, on the [fedmatch website](https://seunglee98.github.io/fedmatch/).
